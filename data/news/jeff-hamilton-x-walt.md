<h5> Walt Opens a new retail store in the vibrant and youthful Chinese city of Changsha under Walt’s NEU INK platform.</h5>

As an artist born in Morocco, studying in Paris, and living and working in the United States, Jeff Hamilton certainly does not miss any country with rich cultu-al heritage that allows him to experience exotic customs and traditions.
<br/>

Jeff Hamilton, who finished curating Complexcon on March 25th, came to Changsha to experience the local customs and folk culture. In his opinion, Changsha has the inheritance of ancient and modern Chinese culture, as well as the exchange and integration of Chinese and Western cultures. The young people here are full of vitality and passion, making it a city with both historical accumulation and vitality. The culture and humanities here will bring him unlimit-ed creative inspiration.

<br/>

After experiencing the charm of Changsha, he came to Shanghai and embarked on a three-day trip. On the afternoon of March 26th, Jeff Hamilton came to Shanghai Rock Park to spend a relaxing time with Vintage store Max Match and fans who love Jeff Hamilton jackets. In addition to Jeff bringing a lot of classic jackets and co branded products that he has made over the years to feast the eyes of the fans present, the manager of Max Match also brought Jeff Hamilton's early collaborations with NASCAR and other products, which made Jeff quite feel the love and persistence of the other side of the ocean. The conversation with fans made Jeff recall a lot of past events. When it comes to the resurgence of racing style jackets today, he has ignited a new interest.
